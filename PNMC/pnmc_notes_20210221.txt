Option 1:

NODE_ENV=myEnvironmentName node index.js

Put your configuration in a file, (eg config.js) which has a switch inside of it.

That switch should read process.env.NODE_ENV to determine the current environment, and export only the config variables for that environment.

Option 2:

Start your app with every configuration variable you're going to need for that environment:

DBpassword=myDBpassword apiToken=mySecretToken port=thePortIShouldRunOn foo=bar node index.js

Option 3:

Read all your configuration from a .env file which gets ignored by source control.

Each dev would put their own .env file in the project prior to beginning localhost work.

Your deployment pipeline would insert an .env file into the repo before it deploys anywhere.

Linters (jshint and jslint) also inform the syntax many devs use.


Erron Handling:

Errback:

Functions should callback two parameters

1. An error (if any)
2. Data being returned (if any)

-----------------------------------------

exampleFunction(function(err,data){ //Check the error //Do stuff with the data });
